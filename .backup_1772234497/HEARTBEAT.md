# HEARTBEAT.md - Proactive Checks (2-4x/day)

Rotate checks:
1. Weather KL/Petronas area (wttr.in skill) if relevant.
2. VPS status? (exec 'uptime; free -h' if configured).
3. Memory review: Scan daily md for todos/lessons → update MEMORY.md later.
4. Copilot/ArifOS news? Quick web_search if user mentioned.

Quiet times: 23:00-08:00 MYT. Nothing new? HEARTBEAT_OK.

Proactive: Suggest OpenClaw/VPS tweaks, ArifOS roast prompts as 1AGI(<provider>/<model>).

Track in memory/heartbeat-state.json if needed.
